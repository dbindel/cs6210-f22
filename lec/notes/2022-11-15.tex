\section{Krylov subspaces}

The {\em Krylov subspace} of dimension $k$ generated by
$A \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ and $b \in \bbR^n$ is
\[
  \mathcal{K}_k(A,b)
    = \operatorname{span}\{ b, Ab, \ldots, A^{k-1} b \}
    = \{ p(A) b : p \in \mathcal{P}_{k-1} \}.
\]
Krylov subspaces are a natural choice for subspace-based methods for
approximate linear solves, for two reasons:
\begin{itemize}
\item If all you are allowed to do with $A$ is compute matrix-vector
  products, and the only vector at hand is $b$, what else would you do?
\item The Krylov subspaces have excellent approximation properties.
\end{itemize}

Krylov subspaces have several properties that are worthy of comment.
Because the vectors $A^{j} b$ are proportional to the vectors obtained
in power iteration, one might reasonably (and correctly)
assume that the space quickly contains good approximations to the
eigenvectors associated with the largest magnitude eigenvalues.
Krylov subspaces are also {\em shift-invariant}, i.e. for any $\sigma$
\[
  \mathcal{K}_k(A-\sigma I, b) = \mathcal{K}_k(A,b).
\]
By choosing different shifts, we can see that the Krylov subspaces
tend to quickly contain not only good approximations to the eigenvector
associated with the largest magnitude eigenvalue, but to all
``extremal'' eigenvalues.

Most arguments about the approximation properties of Krylov subspaces
derive from the characterization of the space as all vectors $p(A) b$
where $p \in \mathcal{P}_{k-1}$ and from the spectral mapping theorem,
which says that if $A = V \Lambda V^{-1}$ then
$p(A) = V p(\Lambda) V^{-1}$.  Hence, the distance between
an arbitrary vector (say $d$) and the Krylov subspace is
\[
  \min_{p \in \mathcal{P}_{k-1}}
  \left\| V \left[ p(\Lambda) V^{-1} b - V^{-1} d \right] \right\|.
\]
As a specific example, suppose that we want to choose $\hat{x}$
in a Krylov subspace in order to minimize the residual $A \hat{x} - b$.
Writing $\hat{x} = p(A) b$, we have that we want to minimize
\[
  \|[A p(A)-I] b\| = \|q(A) b\|
\]
where $q(z)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $k$ such that $q(1) = 1$.
The best possible residual in this case is bounded by
\[
  \|q(A) b\| \leq \kappa(V) \|q(\Lambda)\| \|b\|,
\]
and so the relative residual can be bounded in terms of the condition
number of $V$ and the minimum value that can bound $q$ on the spectrum
of $A$ subject to the constraint that $q(0) = 1$.

\section{Chebyshev polynomials}

Suppose now that $A$ is symmetric positive definite, and we seek to
minimize $\|q(A) b\| \leq \|q(\Lambda)\| \|b\|$.  Controlling $q(z)$
on all the eigenvalues is a pain, but it turns out to be simple to
instead bound $q(z)$ over some interval $[\alpha_1, \alpha_n]$
The polynomial we want is the {\em scaled and shifted Chebyshev polynomial}
\[
  q_m(z) =
  \frac{T_m\left( (z-\bar{\alpha})/\rho \right)}
       {T_m\left( -\bar{\alpha}/\rho \right)}
\]
where $\bar{\alpha} = (\alpha_n + \alpha_1)/2$ and
$\rho = (\alpha_n-\alpha_1)/2$.

The Chebyshev polynomials $T_m$ are defined by the recurrence
\begin{align*}
  T_0(x) &= 1 \\
  T_1(x) &= x \\
  T_{m+1}(x) &= 2x T_m(x) - T_{m-1}(x), \quad m \geq 1.
\end{align*}
The Chebyshev polynomials have a number of remarkable properties, but
perhaps the most relevant in this setting is that
\[
  T_m(x) =
  \begin{cases}
    \cos(m \cos^{-1}(x)), & |x| \leq 1, \\
    \cosh(m \cosh^{-1}(x)), &|x| \geq 1
  \end{cases}.
\]
Thus, $T_m(x)$ oscillates between $\pm 1$ on the interval $[-1,1]$,
and then grows very quickly outside that interval.  In particular,
\[
  T_{m}(1 + \epsilon) \geq \frac{1}{2} (1+m\sqrt{2\epsilon}).
\]
Thus, we have that on $[\alpha_, \alpha_n]$,
$|q_m| \leq \frac{2}{1+m\sqrt{2\epsilon}}$
where
\[
  \epsilon = \bar{\alpha}/\rho-1
  = \frac{2\alpha_1}{\alpha_n-\alpha_1}
  = 2 \left( \kappa(A)-1 \right)^{-1},
\]
and hence
\begin{align*}
  |q_m(z)|
  &\leq \frac{2}{1+2m/\sqrt{\kappa(A)-1}} \\
  &= 2\left( 1- \frac{2m}{\sqrt{\kappa(A)-1}}\right) + O\left(\frac{m^2}{\kappa(A-1)}\right).
\end{align*}
Hence, we expect to reduce the optimal residual in this case
by at least about $2/\sqrt{\kappa(A)-1}$ at each step.

\section{Chebyshev: Uses and Limitations}

We previously sketched out an approach for analyzing the convergence of
methods based on Krylov subspaces:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Characterize the Krylov subspace of interest in terms of polynomials,
  i.e. $\mathcal{K}_k(A,b) = \{ p(A)b : p \in \mathcal{P}_{k-1} \}$.
\item
  For $\hat{x} = p(A) b$, write an associated error (or residual)
  in terms of a related polynomial in $A$.
\item
  Phrase the problem of minimizing the error, residual, etc.~in terms
  of minimizing a polynomial $q(z)$ on the spectrum of $A$
  (call this $\Lambda(A)$).  The polynomial $q$ must generally satisfy
  some side constraints that prevent the zero polynomial from being
  a valid solution.
\item
  Let $\Lambda(A) \subset \Omega$, and write
  \[
    \max_{\lambda \in \Lambda(A)} |q(\lambda)| \leq
    \max_{z \in \Omega} |q(z)|.
  \]
  The set $\Omega$ should be simpler to work with than the set of
  eigenvalues.  The simplest case is when $A$ is symmetric positive
  definite and $\Omega = [\lambda_1, \lambda_n]$.
\item
  The optimization problem can usually be phrased in terms of special
  polynomial families.  The simplest case, when $\Omega$ is just an
  interval, usually leads to an analysis via Chebyshev polynomials.
\end{enumerate}
The analysis sketched above is the basis for the convergence analysis
of the Chebyshev semi-iteration, the conjugate gradient method, and
(with various twists) several other Krylov subspace methods.

The advantage of this type of analysis is that it leads to convergence
bounds in terms of some relatively simple property of the matrix, such
as the condition number.  The disadvantage is that the approximation of
the spectral set $\Lambda(A)$ by a bounding region $\Omega$ can lead to
rather pessimistic bounds.  In practice, the extent to which we are able
to find good solutions in a Krylov subspace often depends on the
``clumpiness'' of the eigenvalues.  Unfortunately, this ``clumpiness''
is rather difficult to reason about a priori!  Thus, the right way to evaluate
the convergence of Krylov methods in practice is usually to try them out,
plot the convergence curves, and see what happens.

\section{Arnoldi}

Krylov subspaces are good spaces for approximation schemes.  But the
power basis (i.e.~the basis $A^j b$ for $j = 0, \ldots, k-1$) is not
good for numerical work.  The vectors in the power basis tend to
converge toward the dominant eigenvector, and so the power basis quickly
becomes ill-conditioned.  We would much rather have orthonormal bases
for the same spaces.  This is where the Arnoldi iteration and its kin
come in.

Each step of the Arnoldi iteration consists of two pieces:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Compute $Aq_k$ to get a vector in the space of dimension $k+1$
\item
  Orthogonalize $Aq_k$ against $q_1, \ldots, q_k$ using Gram-Schmidt.
  Scale the remainder to unit length.
\end{itemize}
If we keep track of the coefficients in the Gram-Schmidt process
in a matrix $H$, we have
\[
  h_{k+1,k} q_{k+1} = Aq_k - \sum_{j=1}^{k} q_j h_{jk}
\]
where $h_{jk} = q_j^T A q_k$ and $h_{k+1,k}$ is the normalization
constant.  Rearranging slightly, we have
\[
  Aq_k = \sum_{j=1}^{k+1} q_j h_{jk}.
\]
Defining $Q_k = \begin{bmatrix} q_1 & q_2 & \ldots & q_k \end{bmatrix}$,
we have the {\em Arnoldi decomposition}
\[
  AQ_k = Q_{k+1} \bar{H}_k, \quad
  \bar{H}_k =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    h_{11} & h_{12} & \ldots & h_{1k} \\
    h_{21} & h_{22} & \ldots & h_{2k} \\
           & h_{32} & \ldots & h_{3k} \\
           &        & \ddots & \vdots \\
           &        &        & h_{k+1,k}
  \end{bmatrix} \in \bbR^{(k+1) \times k}.
\]

The Arnoldi {\em decomposition} is simply the leading $k$ columns of an
upper Hessenberg reduction of the original matrix $A$.  The Arnoldi
{\em algorithm} is the interlaced multiply-and-orthogonalize process
used to obtain the decomposition. % (Figure~\ref{arnoldi-1}).
Unfortunately, the modified Gram-Schmidt algorithm --- though more
stable than classical Gram-Schmidt! --- is nonetheless unstable in
general.  The sore point occurs when we start with a matrix that lies
too near the span of the vectors we orthogonalize against; in this case,
by the time we finish orthogonalizing against previous vectors, we have
cancelled away so much of the original vector that what is left may be
substantially contaminated by roundoff.  For this reason, the
``twice is enough'' reorthogonalization process of Kahan and Parlett
is useful: this says that if the remainder after orthogonalization is
too small compared to what we started with, then we should perhaps
refine our computation by orthogonalizing the remainder again.
%We show this process in Figure~\ref{arnoldi-2}.

\section{Lanczos}

Now suppose that $A$ is a symmetric matrix.  In this case, the Arnoldi
decomposition takes a special form: the upper Hessenberg matrix is now
a symmetric upper Hessenber matrix (aka a tridiagonal), and we dub
the resulting decomposition the {\em Lanczos} decomposition:
\[
  AQ_k = Q_{k+1} \bar{T}_k, \quad
  T_k =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \alpha_1 & \beta_1 \\
    \beta_1 & \alpha_2 & \beta_2 \\
            & \beta_2 & \alpha_3 & \beta_3 \\
            & & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots \\
            & & & \beta_{k-2} & \alpha_{k-1} & \beta_{k-1} \\
            & & & & \beta_{k-1} & \alpha_k \\
            & & & & & \beta_k
  \end{bmatrix}
\]
The Lanczos algorithm is the specialization of the Arnoldi algorithm
to the symmetric case.  In exact arithmetic, the tridiagonal form of
the coefficient matrix allows us to do only a constant amount of
orthogonalization work at each step.

%\begin{figure}
%\lstinputlisting{code/iter/lanczos.m}
%\caption{Lanczos iteration.  Note that in floating point, the columns
%  of $Q$ will lose orthogonality.}
%\label{lanczos}
%\end{figure}

Sadly, the Lanczos algorithm in floating point behaves rather differently
from the algorithm in exact arithmetic.  In particular, the iteration
tends to ``restart'' periodically as the space starts to get very good
approximations of eigenvectors.  One can deal with this via full
reorthogonalization, as with the Arnoldi iteration; but then the method
loses the luster of low cost, as we have to orthogonalize against several
vetors periodically.  An alternate {\em selective orthogonalization}
strategy proposed by Parlett and Scott lets us orthogonalize only against
a few previous vectors, which are associated with converged eigenvector
approximations (Ritz vectors).  But, as we shall see, such orthogonalization
is mostly useful when we want to solve eigenvalue problems.  For linear
systems, it tends not to be necessary.
